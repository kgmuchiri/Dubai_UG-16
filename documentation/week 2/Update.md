# Week 2 Update
## Selection of Topic
We selected Natural Sciences, looking at forecasting of natural phenomena e.g. weather systems, 
wildfires or earthquake aftershocks. Looking into datasets

## Traffic Sign Data Set (Sample data set from previous years)
### A Sample data set (10 classes, 9690 data sample)
The data set is subset the computer vision benchmark data set  “German Street Sign Recognition Benchmark by Stallkamp et al”\
The original data set consists of 39,209 RGB-coloured train and 12,630 RGB-coloured test images of different sizes displaying 43 different types of German traffic signs. \
These images are not centred and are taken during different times of the day. 

You will be working with a sample of this data set which consists of 10 classes and 9690 images. \
The images have been converted to grey-scale with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 and were rescaled to a common size of 48*48 pixels. \
Hence, each row (= feature vector) in the data set has 2305 features and represents a single image in row-vector format (2304 features) plus its associated class label.

Class labels  are  labelled from 0 to 9 indicating the following traffic sign categories:
